## [2025-11-07] - Project Initiated

### Decision: Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind), Vanilla JavaScript
- **Hosting:** Netlify (free)
- **Blog:** Static HTML files (zero monthly cost)
- **Why:** Cost-effective, portable, full ownership, no vendor lock-in

### Decision: Migration Approach
- Preserve current domain (Wix → Netlify redirect)
- Migrate 100+ blog posts via RSS export → HTML conversion
- Keep ~85-90% of existing SEO value through redirects
- Status: Approved

### Decision: Documentation System
- GitHub repo for file storage
- CHANGELOG.md for all changes/deployments
- Living project doc in chat for roadmap reference
- Why: Centralized, backed up, tracked history

### Current Phase
- Planning & requirements gathering
- Brand assets development (in progress with Vlad)
