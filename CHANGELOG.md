## 🎬 MAJOR REBRAND & PIVOT (November 2025)

### Business Focus Change: Event-First, Video-Primary

**OLD:** Corporate photography with events as secondary
**NEW:** Event video & photography - video leads, events primary

**Key Strategic Shifts:**
1. **Video becomes hero service** (was tertiary)
2. **Events become primary focus** (was equal with corporate)
3. **Corporate/headshots secondary** (still important, not lead)
4. **Name change:** Lightroom NYC → Core Visuals NYC

**Why This Works:**
- "Core Visuals" = flexible, not limiting
- "NYC" = geographic SEO signal
- Modern, brandable, professional
- Doesn't pigeonhole into one service

## 📝 COPYWRITING STRATEGY - PAIN POINT FOCUSED

### Client Pain Points We Address:

**1. Agency Bloat**
- **Pain:** Too many layers, can't reach actual creator
- **Solution:** Direct access to the person shooting your event

**2. Hidden Costs**
- **Pain:** Surprise fees, unclear pricing
- **Solution:** Fixed packages, transparent pricing upfront

**3. Slow Turnaround**
- **Pain:** Content arrives weeks later when event is old news
- **Solution:** REMOVED "48 hours" emphasis per client request

**4. One-Size-Fits-All Packages**
- **Pain:** Pay for services you don't need
- **Solution:** Video + photo bundles, or separate - you choose

**5. Unreliable Freelancers**
- **Pain:** Different person every time, inconsistent quality
- **Solution:** Boutique company, same team every event

### Copywriting Principles:
- **Punchy & conversational** - No corporate jargon
- **Scannable** - Short paragraphs, bullet points
- **Benefit-focused** - "So you get X" not "We do Y"
- **Problem-aware** - Show we understand their world
- **Action-oriented** - Clear next steps

## 📊 IMPORTANT NOTES (For Quick Reference)

### Domain Strategy:
✅ **`corevisuals.nyc` is PERFECT - Don't change it!**

**Why?**
- Modern SEO prioritizes content over keyword domains (since 2013)
- Brandable > keyword-stuffed
- "NYC" provides geographic signal
- Flexible as business evolves
- Professional and memorable

**What matters MORE than domain:**
1. Page titles & H1 headings with keywords
2. Content quality & keyword density
3. Backlinks from NYC venues/event sites
4. Google Business Profile optimization
5. Local citations (Yelp, Eventective, etc.)

### Event-First Doesn't Mean Ignore Corporate:
- Keep existing corporate content (don't delete!)
- Just reorder to make events PRIMARY
- Think of it as expanding pyramid, not replacing base
```
     EVENTS (60%)         ← New focus, most prominent
   Corporate (30%)        ← Existing strength, keep it
  Specialized (10%)       ← Supporting services
```

### File Size Guidelines:
**Images (JPG):**
- Portfolio: 1920x1200px, 200-400 KB (80-85% quality)
- Optimize at TinyJPG.com or Squoosh.app

**Video (MP4):**
- Hero background: 1920x1080 or 1280x720
- Length: 10-30 seconds (loops)
- File size: 2-5 MB max
- Compress with HandBrake or CloudConvert.com
- Format: H.264 codec, 24-30fps

## 🎨 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

**"The Art of Asking" + Pain-Point Awareness**

Every design decision removes friction AND addresses a pain point:

- **Clear hierarchy** = Easy to scan → Busy client finds info fast
- **Generous whitespace** = Reduces cognitive load → Not overwhelming
- **Punchy copy** = Gets to the point → Respects their time
- **Transparent pricing** = Removes biggest objection → No fear of surprise costs
- **Video-first messaging** = Matches modern needs → "Finally, someone gets it"
- **Boutique positioning** = Explains difference → "Not another agency!"

**The best design gets out of the way and lets clients say "This is exactly what I need."**
