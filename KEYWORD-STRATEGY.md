## Strategic Insights

### 🏆 The Secret Weapon: "Corporate Video Production NYC"

**Why this is huge:**
- 500 searches/month (same as "event photographer")
- **LOW competition (3/100)** - almost nobody targeting this
- High commercial intent ($5.25-$23.05 bid range)
- People search "corporate video production" more than "corporate videographer"

**What this means:**
Position as a "production company" not just a "videographer" - less competition, same traffic.

### 💰 Pricing Transparency is a Differentiator

**"Corporate event photography pricing" = 500 searches/month**

People are literally searching for pricing information. Your competitors hide pricing - you should highlight it.

**Action items:**
- Include pricing section on every service page
- Use "transparent pricing" and "fixed packages" throughout copy
- Consider a dedicated "/pricing" page
- Mention "starting at $X" where possible

### 📊 One Page Per Service, Not Per Event Type

**Zero searches for:**
- conference photographer nyc
- gala photographer nyc
- networking event photographer nyc
- trade show photographer nyc

**What to do instead:**
Build ONE comprehensive "/event-coverage" page that mentions all event types in the body copy. Google understands topic clusters.

---

### CORPORATE CONTENT PAGE `/corporate-content`

**Primary Keywords:**

- corporate video production company nyc (500/month, LOW competition) ⭐

**Secondary:**

---

### PORTFOLIO PAGE `/portfolio`

**Primary Keywords:** None (portfolio pages rarely rank)

**Purpose:** Conversion, not discovery

**SEO Strategy:**
- Use descriptive image alt text with service type + location
- Example: "Corporate conference photography NYC for tech startup"
- Project titles should be descriptive: "Tech Conference Coverage" not "Project 14"
- Link back to service pages from project descriptions

---

### ABOUT PAGE `/about`

**Primary Keywords:** Core Visuals NYC (brand only)

**SEO Strategy:**
- Optimize for your name and business name
- Include your top keywords ONCE for relevance
- This page won't drive organic traffic - it's for conversion

---

**SEO Strategy:**
- Include intent-based phrases in body copy:
  - "book event photographer NYC"
  - "hire corporate videographer NYC"
  - "get event photography pricing"
- Emphasize transparent pricing and fast response

---

## Content Writing Guidelines

### Keyword Density (Natural Integration)

**Target:** 2-4 mentions per 500 words

**Good example:**
"We provide event photography throughout NYC, covering corporate events, conferences, and company gatherings."

**Bad example:**
"Event photographer NYC event photography NYC provides the best event photographer services in NYC for NYC events."

### Pricing Language (Target: "corporate event photography pricing")

Since people search for pricing, use phrases like:
- "Starting at $X for [service]"
- "Transparent pricing with no hidden fees"
- "Get a fixed quote in 24 hours"
- "All pricing includes [deliverables]"
- "No hourly rates or surprise charges"

### Event Types (Mention ALL in body copy)

While specific types have zero search volume, mention them for topic authority:
- Corporate conferences
- Annual galas
- Fundraising events
- Networking events
- Product launches
- Company parties
- Awards ceremonies
- Trade shows
- Panel discussions
- Team building events

**Why?** Google's algorithm understands topic clusters. A comprehensive page about "event photography NYC" that covers various event types will rank better than a thin page.

---

## What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Build These Pages

- Separate pages for each event type (conference, gala, etc.)
- Neighborhood landing pages (Midtown, Downtown, Manhattan)
- Industry-specific pages (Tech, Nonprofit, Finance)
- "Why Hire a Photographer" or generic blog posts

**Why?** Zero search volume + thin content = pages that hurt your site.

### ❌ Don't Target These Keywords

- "best event photographer NYC" (no volume)
- "top corporate videographer NYC" (no volume)
- "affordable" or "cheap" variations (wrong audience)
- HIGH competition keywords with small search volume (bad ROI)

### ❌ Don't Ignore These Opportunities

- ✅ "corporate video production NYC" (LOW competition!)
- ✅ "corporate event photography pricing" (people searching for pricing!)
- ✅ "event photography rates nyc" (50 searches, LOW competition)
