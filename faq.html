        "text": "Event photography and videography in NYC typically starts around $3,500, though prices vary widely depending on your needs. Coverage could be anything from a 1-hour panel discussion to a full-day conference with multiple rooms. What actually matters: what you need covered, how you plan to use the content, and how fast you need it delivered. We quote fixed pricing based on deliverables, not hours—so you know exactly what you're paying for and what you're getting."

        "text": "Packages include everything you need to actually use the content—professional coverage, full editing, online delivery, and unlimited usage rights. No editing fees, no travel charges within NYC, no licensing restrictions. You choose photo OR video coverage for smaller budgets, or both for comprehensive documentation. Can you customize? Absolutely. We'll build pricing that makes sense for your actual needs."

You pay for results, not time on a stopwatch. Hourly coverage exists for 2-3 hour events where packages don't make sense, but if you're hitting 4+ hours of coverage, fixed packages save you money."

      "name": "Why do prices vary so much between photographers?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because the industry is a mess. Real cost differences come from: deliverables vs. coverage time, editing quality and speed, experience and reliability, and agency markup. Cheaper isn't always worse, expensive isn't always better. What matters is whether you're getting the deliverables you need, at the quality you need, delivered when you need them."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Four things determine your investment: coverage hours, deliverables (count and turnaround speed), complexity (single room vs. multi-room with VIP areas), and format (photo, video, or both). What doesn't affect pricing with us: overtime surprises, editing fees, travel within NYC, file delivery costs, or licensing restrictions."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Standard booking requires a deposit to hold your date (typically 50%), with the balance due before or shortly after your event. Many clients choose to pay in full upfront to simplify their accounting. If you're booking ongoing coverage or a larger project, we can structure payment terms that make sense for your cash flow."

      "name": "Is there a price difference between photo and video coverage?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No—photo and video packages are priced the same when you're choosing one format. The real cost is in showing up, covering the event professionally, and editing deliverables to a usable standard. If you want both photo and video simultaneously, that requires multiple shooters or strategic coverage planning, which increases the investment—but you save $2,500+ by bundling versus booking separately."

        "text": "Team headshots start at $1,500 for a 5-person session—that includes us coming to your office, professional lighting and backdrops, shooting everyone in one efficient session, and delivering fully edited headshots within 7-10 days. Larger teams scale accordingly. We quote based on total people, time needed, and any special requests."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "If you need to reschedule, we'll move your date at no charge with reasonable notice (typically 2+ weeks). Cancellations depend on timing: 30+ days out gets full refund minus administrative fee, 14-29 days out gets partial refund, less than 14 days means deposit is non-refundable. Weather and genuine emergencies? We'll work with you."

        "text": "You just did. Most of this FAQ has pricing ranges and starting points because we believe in transparency, not hiding numbers behind lead capture forms. What we can't do is quote exact pricing without knowing your specific needs. Email us your event details or schedule a 15-minute call, and we'll quote you transparent pricing within 24 hours."

        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="answer-1">
            How much does event photography and videography cost in NYC?
          </button>
          <div id="answer-1" class="faq-answer" aria-hidden="true">
            <p><strong>Event photography and videography in NYC typically starts around $3,500</strong>, though prices vary widely depending on your needs. Coverage could be anything from a 1-hour panel discussion to a full-day conference with multiple rooms.</p>

            <p>What actually matters: what you need covered, how you plan to use the content, and how fast you need it delivered.</p>

            <p>I've been there—most photographers charge hourly and hope you don't ask what happens when your event runs over. Agencies add 40-60% markup on top of freelancer rates and call it "project management." We quote fixed pricing based on <strong>deliverables, not hours</strong>—so you know exactly what you're paying for and what you're getting.</p>

            <p><strong>What affects the investment?</strong> Coverage time, number of deliverables, turnaround speed, and whether you need photo, video, or both. A 3-hour cocktail reception with 100 photos delivered in two weeks costs less than an 8-hour conference with 400 photos and a highlight reel delivered in 5 days. Makes sense, right?</p>

            <p><strong>The smart move:</strong> <a href="contact.html">Tell us about your event</a> and we'll quote you transparent, fixed pricing with no surprises. Schedule a call or email us and we'll talk through what makes sense for your specific situation.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="answer-2">
            What's included in your packages, and can I customize?
          </button>
          <div id="answer-2" class="faq-answer" aria-hidden="true">
            <p><strong>Packages include everything you need to actually use the content</strong>—professional coverage, full editing, online delivery, and unlimited usage rights. No "editing fees," no "travel charges within NYC," no licensing restrictions, no BS.</p>

            <p>Here's how it works: <strong>You choose photo OR video coverage for smaller budgets, or both for comprehensive documentation.</strong> We quote based on hours needed and deliverables you want. Essential coverage (up to 5 hours) works for focused events. Professional coverage (6-8 hours) handles full-day conferences. Premium coverage adds 2-camera video and dual shooters for complex events.</p>

            <p><strong>Can you customize?</strong> Absolutely. Need rush delivery? Specific sponsor documentation? Coverage across multiple rooms? We'll build pricing that makes sense for your actual needs—not force you into a package that's 70% right and 30% stuff you don't need.</p>

            <p><strong>The process:</strong> <a href="contact.html">Reach out</a> with your event details, and we'll walk through options that fit your goals and budget.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="answer-3">
            Do you charge by the hour or fixed packages?
          </button>
          <div id="answer-3" class="faq-answer" aria-hidden="true">
            <p><strong>We're package-first because hourly pricing is designed to confuse you.</strong> Ever notice how "hourly" photographers never quite explain what happens when your event runs 15 minutes over? Or how editing time gets calculated? That's intentional.</p>

            <p>We quote <strong>fixed pricing based on what you need</strong>—coverage hours, deliverable count, and turnaround speed. You pay for results, not time on a stopwatch. If your event runs a bit long, we don't pull out a calculator mid-reception.</p>

            <p>That said, <strong>hourly coverage exists for 2-3 hour events</strong> where packages don't make sense (small award ceremonies, executive panels, quick receptions). But if your event runs 4+ hours of coverage, fixed packages save you money and eliminate the "will this go over budget?" stress.</p>

            <p><strong>What's right for your event?</strong> <a href="contact.html">Let's talk</a>—we'll quote both options and you can see the math yourself.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="answer-4">
            Why do prices vary so much between photographers?
          </button>
          <div id="answer-4" class="faq-answer" aria-hidden="true">
            <p><strong>Because the industry is a mess, and most photographers don't explain what you're actually paying for.</strong> Here's what drives real cost differences:</p>

            <p><strong>1. Deliverables vs. coverage time</strong> – Some charge $2,000 and hand you 50 unedited photos. We charge more and deliver 300+ fully edited images. Different products, different pricing.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Editing quality and speed</strong> – Industry standard is 30-60 days. We deliver in 5-15 days because we built a workflow for it. Faster costs more.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Experience and reliability</strong> – A freelancer juggling five clients charges less than a production company with backup equipment, backup shooters, and liability insurance. You're paying for "what happens if something goes wrong."</p>

            <p><strong>4. Agency markup</strong> – If you're going through an agency, 40-60% of your payment goes to the middleman, not the photographer.</p>

            <p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Cheaper isn't always worse, and expensive isn't always better. What matters is <strong>whether you're getting the deliverables you need, at the quality you need, delivered when you need them.</strong></p>

        <!-- Question 5 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="answer-5">
            What affects the final price of my event coverage?
          </button>
          <div id="answer-5" class="faq-answer" aria-hidden="true">
            <p><strong>Four things determine your investment:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>1. Coverage hours</strong> – A 3-hour event costs less than an 8-hour event. Pretty straightforward.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Deliverables</strong> – 150 photos delivered in 10 days costs less than 400 photos delivered in 5 days. Faster + more = higher investment.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Complexity</strong> – Single room conference? Standard pricing. Multi-room event with sponsor booths, VIP areas, and breakout sessions? That requires multiple shooters or strategic coverage planning.</p>

            <p><strong>4. Photo, video, or both</strong> – Video requires different equipment, editing workflow, and skill set. Comprehensive coverage (photo + video) costs more than choosing one format.</p>

            <p><strong>Here's what doesn't affect pricing with us:</strong> Overtime surprises, "editing fees," travel within NYC, file delivery costs, or licensing restrictions. That stuff's included.</p>

            <p><strong>The smart approach:</strong> <a href="contact.html">Tell us about your event</a> and we'll quote transparent pricing based on these four factors. If something's outside your budget, we'll tell you what adjustments bring it in range.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 6 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="answer-6">
            Do you offer payment plans or deposits?
          </button>
          <div id="answer-6" class="faq-answer" aria-hidden="true">
            <p><strong>Yes—we're not trying to make this harder than it needs to be.</strong></p>

            <p>Standard booking requires a <strong>deposit to hold your date</strong> (typically 50%), with the balance due before or shortly after your event. Many clients choose to pay in full upfront to simplify their accounting and close out the project faster.</p>

            <p>If you're booking ongoing coverage (quarterly events, monthly content) or a larger project, <strong>we can structure payment terms that make sense for your cash flow.</strong> The goal is to make great coverage accessible, not create financing obstacles.</p>

            <p><strong>The conversation:</strong> <a href="contact.html">Reach out</a> when you're ready to book, and we'll work out payment terms that fit your situation. We're flexible on structure, firm on delivering what we promise.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 7 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="answer-7">
            Is there a price difference between photo and video coverage?
          </button>
          <div id="answer-7" class="faq-answer" aria-hidden="true">
            <p><strong>No—photo and video packages are priced the same</strong> when you're choosing one format. Here's why: the real cost is in <strong>showing up, covering the event professionally, and editing deliverables to a usable standard.</strong> Whether we're clicking a shutter or recording video, the labor and expertise are equivalent.</p>

            <p><strong>Where pricing changes:</strong> If you want <strong>both photo and video simultaneously</strong>, that requires either multiple shooters or strategic coverage planning, which increases the investment. But it's less than booking photo and video separately—typically <strong>you save $2,500+ by bundling.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>What this means practically:</strong></p>
            <p>• Choose photo coverage → Get 300+ edited images<br>
            • Choose video coverage → Get 4-6 minute highlight reel<br>
            • Choose both → Get comprehensive documentation (and save money vs. booking separately)</p>

        <!-- Question 8 -->
        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="answer-8">
            How much do professional team headshots cost?
          </button>
          <div id="answer-8" class="faq-answer" aria-hidden="true">
            <p><strong>Team headshots start at $1,500 for a 5-person session</strong>—that includes us coming to your office, professional lighting and backdrops, shooting everyone in one efficient session, and delivering fully edited headshots within 7-10 days. Each person gets 2-3 final options to choose from.</p>

            <p><strong>Larger teams?</strong> Pricing scales, but not linearly. A 10-person session doesn't cost 2x a 5-person session because setup and travel are fixed costs. <strong>We quote based on total people, time needed, and any special requests</strong> (executives wanting more options, specific backdrop requirements, rush delivery).</p>

            <p><strong>What affects headshot pricing:</strong></p>
            <p>• Team size (5 vs. 50 people)<br>
            • Time per person (10 minutes vs. 20 minutes for executives)<br>
            • Turnaround speed (standard 7-10 days vs. rush 48-hour delivery)<br>
            • Setup complexity (simple backdrop vs. branded environment)</p>

            <p><strong>The process:</strong> <a href="contact.html">Tell us how many people need headshots</a> and any specific requirements, and we'll quote transparent pricing. If budget's tight, we'll show you what adjustments bring costs down (fewer options per person, longer turnaround, etc.).</p>

          <div id="answer-9" class="faq-answer" aria-hidden="true">
            <p><strong>Life happens. We get it.</strong></p>

            <p>If you need to reschedule, <strong>we'll move your date at no charge as long as we have reasonable notice</strong> (typically 2+ weeks). Your deposit transfers to the new date, no penalties.</p>

            <p><strong>Cancellations depend on timing:</strong></p>
            <p>• <strong>30+ days out:</strong> Full refund minus a small administrative fee<br>
            • <strong>14-29 days out:</strong> Partial refund (we've likely turned down other work)<br>
            • <strong>Less than 14 days:</strong> Deposit is non-refundable (we've blocked the date and can't rebook)</p>

            <p><strong>Weather, emergencies, and force majeure?</strong> We'll work with you. If your outdoor event gets rained out and you reschedule, we reschedule. If there's a genuine emergency, we're not going to nickel-and-dime you over policies.</p>

            <p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> We want you to feel confident booking, not stressed about "what if." <a href="contact.html">Questions about our policies? Ask us directly.</a></p>

          <div id="answer-10" class="faq-answer" aria-hidden="true">
            <p><strong>You just did.</strong> Most of this FAQ has pricing ranges and starting points because <strong>we believe in transparency, not hiding numbers behind lead capture forms.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>What we can't do:</strong> Quote you exact pricing without knowing your specific needs. A 3-hour corporate headshot session costs different than an 8-hour conference with 2-camera video and rush delivery. The variables matter.</p>

            <p><strong>What we can do:</strong> <a href="contact.html">Talk to you like an adult</a> about what you need, quote you fixed pricing with no surprises, and explain exactly what you're paying for. No bait-and-switch, no "well actually the price is higher," no pressure tactics.</p>

            <p><strong>The approach:</strong> Email us your event details or schedule a 15-minute call. We'll quote you transparent pricing within 24 hours. If it fits your budget, great. If it doesn't, we'll tell you what adjustments bring it in range—or recommend someone who might be a better fit.</p>
